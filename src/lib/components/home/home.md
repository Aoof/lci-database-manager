# LCI Databases Management (Home Page)

## About the Project

**LCI Databases Management** is the final project for our first-year *Databases 1* course at *Collège LaSalle Montréal*, led by professor **Huu Con Nguyen**. This project focuses on designing, normalizing, and implementing a robust database system while presenting it through an interactive website.

## Our Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Theoretically craft a well-structured database model.
- Normalize the database to optimize efficiency and integrity.
- Implement the database using industry best practices.
- Develop a website to visualize and interact with the database seamlessly.

## Our Team

We are a team of dedicated students, each bringing expertise in databases and web development:

- **Abdulrahman** – Website Frontend, proficient in databases and responsible for integrating the frontend with the database.
- **Shayan** – Website Backend, proficient in databases, handling backend development and server-side database interactions.
- **Sofia** – Database specialist, contributing to database design and implementation.
- **Akshay** – Database specialist, assisting in data normalization and optimization.

## Implementation & Technologies

Our approach includes:
- **Database Modeling:** Designing an efficient database schema.
- **Normalization:** Ensuring data integrity and eliminating redundancy.
- **Frontend Development:** Building a user-friendly interface to interact with the database, and an implementation of showing the code in the website.
    ```sql
    -- Example SQL code for database creation
    CREATE TABLE Users (
        UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        Password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

    ```js
    console.log("An example of JavaScript code for frontend interaction");
    ```
- **Backend Development:** Implementing secure and efficient data retrieval and management.

## Conclusion

LCI Databases Management is a collaborative effort to apply our database knowledge in a real-world scenario. By combining theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation, we aim to create a functional and well-optimized database system that seamlessly integrates with a dynamic website.
